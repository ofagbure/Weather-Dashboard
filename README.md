# Weather-Dashboard
As a frequent traveler, I wanted to create a weather dashboard for a few of my most frequented/ loved cities. This application will also let me search for cities I plan to visit.

## Description 

This is a basic weather dashboard app that shows weather conditions for a given city. It shows the current weather as well as a 5 day forecast. Click [here](https://ofagbure.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/) to see the deployed site!

## Functionality

The app works by taking input from the user (a desired city), and then providing weather information for the city. The app provides basic current weather conditions, as well as a 5 day forecast for that city from the day the request is submitted
